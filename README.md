# DataFrames.jl-Exercises

This repository is inspired by the [Pandas exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) repository. While the data and structure remain the same, the key distinction lies in this repository's focus on demonstrating how to perform data engineering, data cleaning, and data visualization tasks. All exercises are adapted for Julia language using the DataFrames.jl library.

## File Types

There are three types of files included in this repository:

1. **Exercise Instructions**: Detailed instructions for each exercise.
2. **Solutions without Code**: Solutions presented without accompanying code.
3. **Solutions with Code and Comments**: Solutions with detailed code and explanatory comments.

Feel free to explore and enhance your skills in data manipulation and visualization using Julia and DataFrames.jl.
